"""Build leakage-safe pre-game features (data/processed/nba_features.csv).

Every feature for a game uses only games that finished BEFORE it. The pattern:
    1. Reshape games into one row per team per game ("team-games").
    2. Within each team and season, sort by date, shift(1) so the current game
       is excluded, then take a rolling mean over the previous N games.
    3. Attach each team's features back onto the game as home_* / away_*.

Features:
    - recent form: win % (last 5 / 10), points scored / allowed and point
      differential (last 10)
    - rest: days since the team's previous game, back-to-back flag
    - home court: 1 for a true home game, 0 for a neutral-site game
    - Elo: each team's rating before tip-off and the implied home win probability

Elo is computed over the warm-up seasons too, so ratings are realistic by the
start of 2020-21; only the modeling seasons are written to the features file.
